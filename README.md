Machine Learning-Based Heart Disease Prediction Project ❤️🔍


Overview

Welcome to the Machine Learning-Based Heart Disease Prediction Project! 🏥💡 This project leverages machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on various patient features. Our goal is to provide a reliable and efficient tool for early detection and risk assessment, contributing to better health outcomes.
Key Features ✨

    Predictive Models: Utilizes multiple machine learning models to predict heart disease risk.
    Comprehensive Dataset: Includes a dataset with features such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and more.
    Interactive Dashboard: Features an intuitive interface to input data and view predictions.
    Model Evaluation: Provides performance metrics and model evaluations to ensure accuracy.

Project Structure 🗂️

    data/: Contains the dataset and any data preprocessing scripts.
    notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis, model training, and evaluation.
    src/: Source code for data processing, model training, and predictions.
    app.py: Main application script to run the interactive prediction tool.
    requirements.txt: List of required Python packages.

Getting Started 🚀
Prerequisites

    Python 3.8+
    Virtual environment (recommended)

Installation

    Clone the Repository

    bash

git clone https://github.com/sharrybhatti/Machine-learning-based-Heart-Disease-Prediction-project.git
cd Machine-learning-based-Heart-Disease-Prediction-project

Set Up a Virtual Environment

bash

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

Install Dependencies

bash

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

    Run the Application

    bash

    streamlit run app.py

    Interact with the App
        Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:8501.
        Input patient data such as age, cholesterol levels, etc.
        View the heart disease risk prediction based on the input data.

Training the Model

    Explore Data and Train Models
        Use the Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks/ folder to explore the dataset and train different machine learning models.
        Evaluate model performance and choose the best-performing model for predictions.

    Update the Model
        If you have new data or improvements to the model, update the code in src/ and retrain as needed.
